                    We know how important your wedding day is and we promise to do all we can to make it incredibly memorable and special.
                    To make sure that your wedding celebration is exactly as you envision, we assign each couple a dedicated event co-ordinator who will meet with you to discuss your needs. We have great experience hosting weddings and special occasions, and are happy to work with all manner of requests.
                    We have fantastic relationships with a number of external suppliers and will be happy to recommend everything from the perfect photographer to the most beautiful wedding stationery. Our talented in-house florist is an expert in crafting beautiful arrangements and specialises in intimate celebrations.
                    The Spa
                    The Spa at Mandarin Oriental is a sensory retreat where bride and groom can luxuriate in preparation for the day. After the event, our spa’s couples’ suite is the perfect place to reflect on the celebration.
                    With Weddings and Honeymoons by Mandarin Oriental, couples who wed at our hotel receive a complimentary honeymoon night and other special benefits at another Mandarin Oriental hotel in the Group.
